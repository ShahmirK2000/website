    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="introductionp"> 
        Hi, my name is Shahmir Mahmud Khan, I was born and raised in upstate New York, and am super passionate about learning. I am currently 24 years old. My hobbies include coding, traveling,
        playing guitar, competing in esports, and more. My career goal is to improve upon software in many different industries including
        healthcare, education, robotics, etc. I am educated in many different areas such as programming, software development techniques, model-driven development, 
        biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, and other medical sciences.

        <strong>B.S. Biomedical Science - University at Buffalo (2024)</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="introductionp">
        <strong>M.S. Software Engineering - Rochester Institute of Technology (2026)</strong>
    </p>

    <p class = "introductionp">
        I recieved my <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Science</strong> degree from the University at Buffalo. I have always
        been passionate about medicinal sciences, and chose to study Biomedical Science as a stepping point for me to become a praticing physician.
        However, during my undergraduate education, I was very involved in my former First Robotics team in high school. The more I mentored the students 
        there, the more I realized that my true passion was for software development. During this time, I had started to study for the MCAT, or the Medical College Admission Test.
        I decided to stop studying for the entrance exam for medical schools, and started applying to schools that would allow me to step into the world of software development. 
        I was accepted into the Rochester Institute of Technology, and am currently pursuing a <strong>Master's of Science in Software Engineering</strong>. My
        goal is to use this degree, with my pre-existing skills that I obtained during my undergraduate program to improve upon software, not only in medicine, but many
        industries thoughout my career.

        <strong>Sofware Coach / 2014 - Present</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="introductionp"> 
        I mentor a First Robotics team called Souther Tier Robotics based in Vestal, New York. I was previously on the team
        for four years during high school. The team competes in multiple First Robotics competitions every year, this includes 
        designing and building a brand new robot every year for a game. The game changes every year, and we are only given 6 weeks
        to design and implement everything we need to compete. I help students develop software for the robot, mostly in C++, this includes the entire
        control system and other various components, such as using an arduino to code LEDs on the robot. First Robotics is an amazing opportunity for high school students,
        and my goal with mentoring the team has always been to introduce and enhance their skills in hardware and software development.

        <strong>Community Lead & Student Player / 2021 - 2024</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="introductionp"> 
        During my time at the University at Buffalo I was involved in the Student Gaming Association on campus. I was the captain and IGL (in game leader) of the varsity Counter-Strike team and was also a community lead. 
        My responsibilities included overseeing team coordination, practice schedules, as well as community outreach and funding for events. I was directly involved in the planning and execution of events
        that the SGA held. I handled marketing to get more students involved in the club, and grew the Counter-Strike community from 12 students to over 150 members. The events we ran were a huge success,
        and involved holding competitions, giving out prizes, and had a large group of the students participate in person.
