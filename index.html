    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="introductionp"> 
        Hi, my name is Shahmir Mahmud Khan, I was born and raised in upstate New York, and am super passionate about learning. I am currently 24 years old. My hobbies include coding, traveling,
        playing guitar, competing in esports, and more. My career goal is to improve upon software in many different industries including
        healthcare, education, robotics, etc. I am educated in many different areas such as programming, software development techniques, model-driven development, 
        biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, and other medical sciences.

        <strong>B.S. Biomedical Science - University at Buffalo (2024)</strong>
    </p>

    <p class="introductionp">
        <strong>M.S. Software Engineering - Rochester Institute of Technology (2026)</strong>
    </p>

    <p class = "introductionp">
        I recieved my <strong>Bachelor's of Science in Biomedical Science</strong> degree from the University at Buffalo. I have always
        been passionate about medicinal sciences, and chose to study Biomedical Science as a stepping point for me to become a praticing physician.
        However, during my undergraduate education, I was very involved in my former First Robotics team in high school. The more I mentored the students 
        there, the more I realized that my true passion was for software development. During this time, I had started to study for the MCAT, or the Medical College Admission Test.
        I decided to stop studying for the entrance exam for medical schools, and started applying to schools that would allow me to step into the world of software development. 
        I was accepted into the Rochester Institute of Technology, and am currently pursuing a <strong>Master's of Science in Software Engineering</strong>. My
        goal is to use this degree, with my pre-existing skills that I obtained during my undergraduate program to improve upon software, not only in medicine, but many
        industries thoughout my career.
